# SignalHost Next Actions

Keep this file current so work can resume after context compaction.

## Current Immediate Mode

The user requested a persistent memory system because repeated context compaction caused regressions. This file is part of that system.

Current slice:

- Hardening only: baseline lock, audit script, debug visibility, and regression tests.
- No live voice behavior changes.
- No routing changes.
- Deploy only if the user wants the debug metadata endpoint changes live.

## Current Voice Situation

The latest analyzed Olive & Ember call hit the correct OpenAI Realtime SIP path but still had bad caller experience:

- Full greeting appears in transcript.
- Audio diagnostic shows greeting audio from about `1.0s` to `3.9s`.
- Caller said "Hello?" around `8.5s`.
- Agent did not respond until around `13.5s`.
- End of call had broken overlap.

Do not fix this until the user explicitly approves a proposed approach.

Likely next technical discussion:

- How to make greeting playout/listening unlock more deterministic.
- How to avoid false post-greeting dead air.
- How to keep current speakerphone progress without loosening the system.

## High Priority Product Work Still Open

These are important but should not distract from the current voice stability issue unless the user chooses them:

- Stripe checkout/subscription activation.
- Final SMS/A2P registration and production texting.
- Production email/webhook hardening.
- Owner assistant polish.
- Learning loop polish.
- Follow-up queue and revenue recovery.
- More vertical-specific analytics/reporting QA.
- Address capture/geocoding with Google Places.
- Integration/premium toolkit strategy.

## Call Testing Checklist

When the user makes a test call:

1. Ask/identify which number/business.
2. Fetch latest call for that location.
3. Confirm call path.
4. Use audio diagnostic.
5. Summarize exactly what happened.
6. Only propose changes after analysis.

## Do Not Forget

- The user is highly sensitive to regressions now.
- Do not say a call cannot be listened to; use the debug path.
- Do not make fixes when the user asks only for analysis.
- Do not re-open LiveKit unless explicitly requested.
- Do not switch voice providers.
- Do not change routing while debugging prompt/voice behavior.
